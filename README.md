# Haskins-project
This repository contains code that leverages public datasets from various research teams, along with an unpublished dataset of young children's reading responses (from NTNU), to model and analyze the predictive power of different psycolinguistic variables of {Chinese single character or compound words} on {reaction time or accuracy} in {naming or lexical decision tasks}. The goal is to investigate whether effects observed in English (e.g., the Strain effect) are also present in Chinese. 

### The public datasets included in this repository are:
- **Chinese Single Characters:**
  - Liu, Shu, & Li (2007). *Behavioral Research Methods, 39*(2), 192–198.
  - Chang et al. (2016). *Behavioral Research Methods, 48*, 112–122.
  - Chang & Lee (2020). *Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 27*(6), 1317–1324.
  - Hsieh, Marelli, & Rastle (2024). *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 50*(5), 819.

- **Chinese Compound Words:**
  - Tse et al. (2017). *Behavioral Research Methods, 49*, 1503–1519.
  - Tse et al. (2023). *Behavioral Research Methods, 55*(8), 4382–4402.
